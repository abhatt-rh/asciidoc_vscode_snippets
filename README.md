# AsciiDoc snippets for Visual Studio Code

VS Code snippets are templates that make it easier to enter repeating code patterns, such as loops or conditional-statements.

VS Code Snippets are written in JSON. Each snippet is defined under a snippet `name` and has a `scope`, `prefix`, `body`, and `description`. If `scope` is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The `prefix` is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted.

In the `vscoderh.code-snippets` file, I have only specified the `name`, `prefix`, and `body` parameters. Since the `name` seemed intuitive to me, I dropped the `description`.

Here is an example of a VS Code snippet for a note:

```
"note": {
      "body": "[NOTE]\n====\n$1\n====\n$0",
      "prefix": "note"
    },
```

1. After you install VS Code on you Linux distro, you will find a `Code` directory under `/home/<kerberos_ID>/.config`.
2. Place the attached snippets file under `/home/<kerberos_ID>/.config/Code/User/snippets`.

To test and verify if the snippets are working as expected, open a new file (without specifying the language) in VS Code and type a snippet name; for example, "note".
