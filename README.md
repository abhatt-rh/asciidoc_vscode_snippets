# Visual Studio Code snippets for AsciiDoc 

VS Code snippets are templates that make it easier to enter repeating code patterns, such as loops or conditional-statements.

VS Code Snippets are written in JSON. Each snippet is defined under a snippet `name` and has a `scope`, `prefix`, `body`, and `description`. If `scope` is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The `prefix` is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted.

The `asciidoc-vscode.code-snippets` file includes snippets for the AsciiDoc language that is used at Red Hat for authoring content.

Additionally, it also includes snippets for Modular documentation templates (for concept, procedure, reference, and assembly) and a technology preview snippet (to indicate that a feature is in Technology Preview).

I have only specified the `name`, `prefix`, and `body` parameters. Since the `name` seemed intuitive to me, I dropped the `description`.

Here is an example of a VS Code snippet for a *NOTE*:

```
"note": {
      "body": "[NOTE]\n====\n$1\n====\n$0",
      "prefix": "note"
    },
```

1. After you install VS Code on your Linux distro, you will find a `Code` directory under `/home/<kerberos_ID>/.config`.
2. Place the snippets file under `/home/<kerberos_ID>/.config/Code/User/snippets`.

To test and verify if the snippets are working as expected, open a new file (without specifying the language) in VS Code and type a snippet name and press **Tab**; for example, "note".
