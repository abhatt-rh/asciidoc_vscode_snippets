# Visual Studio Code snippets for AsciiDoc 

VS Code snippets are templates that make it easier to enter repeating code patterns, such as loops or conditional-statements.

This extension provides snippets for the AsciiDoc language that is used at Red Hat for authoring content.

Additionally, it also includes snippets for Modular documentation templates (for concept, procedure, reference, and assembly) and a technology preview snippet (to indicate that a feature is in Technology Preview).

Here is an example of a VS Code snippet for a *NOTE*:

```
"note": {
      "body": "[NOTE]\n====\n$1\n====\n$0",
      "prefix": "note"
    },
```

To test and verify if the snippets are working as expected, open a new file (without specifying the language) in VS Code and type a snippet name and press **Tab**; for example, "note".

![create a new file, start typing note , call completion with tab then accept the completion, it inserts the full content for a note](images/note_snippet_vscode.gif)
